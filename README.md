# **Basic Ruby**

This repository will have some Ruby code and will show what and how to use this. (I recommend knowing basic Python before attempting this)

### Tips and Tricks for Ruby!

1. What to install before using Ruby on Visual Studio Code?
    - You would want to install the extensions:
        - Ruby
        - VSCode Ruby

2. Make sure that when you do make a Ruby file, it ends in ".rb"!

3. Most of the comments in the Ruby file are guides as to what they do and more in depth of how they work

4. The folders that exist in this repository are exercises for projects!

5. To run a ruby project, you will need to type out "ruby file_name.rb"!
    - example:
        - ruby App.rb
