# **Basic Ruby**

This repository will have some Ruby code and will show what and how to use this. (I recommend knowing basic Python before attempting this)

### Tips and Tricks for Ruby!

1. What to install before using Ruby on Visual Studio Code?
    You would want to install the extensions:
        - Ruby
        - VSCode Ruby

2. Make sure that when you do make a Ruby file, it ends in ".rb"!

3. Most of the comments in the Ruby file are guides as to what they do and more in depth of how they work
